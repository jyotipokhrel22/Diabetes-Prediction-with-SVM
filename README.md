# Diabetes-Prediction-with-SVM
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict diabetes based on health metrics from the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. The model evaluates features such as glucose levels, BMI, and age to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of health metrics for 768 individuals, including:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0 or 1), where 1 indicates diabetes and 0 indicates no diabetes
